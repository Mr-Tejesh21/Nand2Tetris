Nand2Tetris : Build a Modern Computer from First Principles : From NAND to Tetris I(https://www.coursera.org/learn/build-a-computer) & II(https://www.coursera.org/learn/nand2tetris2).

This course is a wonderful journey of 2 parts, available in coursera, taught by professor Noam Nisan and professor Shimon Shocken.
Anyone interested in designing a computer without any prior knowledge can blindly dive into this course and start learning.
For any computer, logic gates are the basic building blocks.
Using logic gates only, all the processors, memory units etc are made. In this course, as the name says, NAND gate is considered for building all the required units for computer like register, memory, CPU etc.The reason behind this is, NAND gate is easy to fabricate and by using NAND gate, one can implement all other logic gates.  

And then we create a programming language and using that we can build games like Tetris and so on. Some of the cool stuff made by students can be found here(https://www.nand2tetris.org/copy-of-talks).The reason behind this is, NAND gate is easy to fabricate and by using NAND gate, one can implement all other logic gates. 

At the end of this course, one can build their own computer virtually. To make this possible, 
instead of using the standard Hardware Description Languages(like VHDL, Verilog....), the team developed a new HDL, which is easy to learn and implement.
Kudos to the efforts made by team.

This repo is an attemp to help the newbies for the course who are finding it difficult to finish the projects.

NOTE: Kindly use this repo for reference only. Do not copy the codes.
